Phon supports \r\nmultimedia data linkage, unit segmentation (e.g. utterance, word), \r\nmultiple-blind transcription, automatic labeling of data (features, \r\nsyllabification), and systematic comparisons between target (model) and actual \r\n(produced) phonological forms. Phon is also equipped with many facilities for \r\ndata analysis, including query methods for phonology (e.g. phones, features, \r\nsyllables, …) as well as acoustic data.\r\n\r\nVersion 2 of Phon brings together two of the most important areas of empirical \r\ninvestigation in the are of child phonology, as it integrates transcript-based \r\nanalyses of phonological data with the facilities for acoustic analysis provided \r\nby Praat. With this new version of Phon, and in addition to the functions listed \r\nabove, the user can now:\r\n\r\n * Import existing TextGrids into Phon sessions\r\n * Generate TextGrids from existing Phon records\r\n * Visualize TextGrids directly into Phon\r\n * Send TextGrids to Praat for editing in a single click\r\n * Run speech analysis functions directly from the Phon Query menu\r\n * Export speech measurement data for further analysis \r\n\r\nAll of these functions are accessible through a user-friendly graphical interface. \r\nDatabases managed within Phon can also be queried using a powerful search system \r\nadapted for the needs of the phonologist. This software program works on Mac OS X, \r\nWindows and Linux platforms and is compliant with the [https://childes.psy.cmu.edu/ CHILDES] \r\n(​[https://www.talkbank.org TalkBank]) XML data \r\nformat. Phon is being made freely available to the community as open-source \r\nsoftware. Phon facilitates data exchange among researchers and is currently used \r\nfor the elaboration of the shared ​PhonBank database, designed to support \r\nempirical needs of research in all areas of phonology and phonological development. \r\n\r\nFor more information, see https://www.phon.ca\r\n","google":"UA-41887261-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
