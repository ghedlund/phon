## Data Preparation


    
## PCC/PVC Summary

The *PCC/PVC Summary* tables displays # Target, # Correct, # Substituted, # Deleted, # Epenthesis, PCC/PVC  (Percent Consonant/Vowel Correct).  When displaying the summary for "All Participants" each row is the summary for a single speaker with a final row displaying totals for all speakers. When displaying the summary for a participant, each row is the totals for the participant in the indicated session.  The caption of the table will be “All Participants” or “Participant Name”.
