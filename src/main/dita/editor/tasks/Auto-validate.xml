            <step>
                <cmd>Ensure that the <uicontrol>Blind transcription</uicontrol> check box is
                    deselected and double-click on the session that you would like to validate. </cmd>
                <stepresult>This will open the <wintitle>Session Editor</wintitle> for the specific
                session.</stepresult>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Open the <wintitle>IPA Validation</wintitle> view and click the <uicontrol>Auto
                        validate</uicontrol> button at the top.</cmd>
                <stepresult>This will open the <wintitle>Auto-validate Session</wintitle>
                    dialog.</stepresult>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>In the <uicontrol>Tiers</uicontrol> field, choose whether to
                        <uicontrol>Auto-validate IPA Target</uicontrol> and/or
                        <uicontrol>Auto-validate IPA Actual</uicontrol> by selecting the check
                    boxes. Also choose whether to overwrite existing data present in the selected
                    tiers by selecting the <uicontrol>Overwrite existing data</uicontrol> check
                    box.</cmd>
                <stepresult>
                    <note>By default, auto-validation will not overwrite data already present in the
                        selected tier(s). The purpose of this is to preserve any transcription which
                        was entered in default mode, or chosen in earlier validations.</note>

                    transcriber.</cmd>
                <stepresult>In the event that there is more than one blind transcription for the
                    selected tier in a single record, this transcriber's input will be chosen to
                    fill the tier.</stepresult>

            <step>
                <cmd>In the <uicontrol>Record Selection</uicontrol> field, choose whether to
                    validate <uicontrol>All records</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Specific
                        records</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Records for participant(s)</uicontrol>, or
                        <uicontrol>Records from search results</uicontrol>.</cmd>
                <stepresult>
                    <note>If you choose to validate only specific records, you will have to specify
                        the relevant record numbers. To specify several individual record numbers,
                        separate them with a comma and a space. To specify a range, separate the
                        beginning and end record numbers with two periods and a space. If you choose
                        to validate records for specific participants, you must select the
                        participants from the list. If you choose the validate records from search
                        results, you must select a past search from the list.</note>
