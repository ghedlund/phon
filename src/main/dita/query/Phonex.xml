    <title>Phonex</title>
    <shortdesc>A phone pattern matching language.</shortdesc>
    <conbody>
        <p>Phonex is a language built specifically for <i>Phon</i> which allows the use of
            expressions known to most linguists (e.g. onset, coda, affricate, uvular, etc.) in
            several of <i>Phon's</i> queries (Data Tier, Aligned Phones, and AlignedGroups).
            Although phonex may initially appear complicated, it uses linguistic terminology. </p>
        <p>Phonex allows you to run queries for phones or metaphones of interest (e.g. stress
            markers, syllable boundary markers). Queries can range from very broad to very specific.
            For instance, you can run a query for all instances of [b] (e.g. in word-initial,
            stressed positions), or for all labials (in any position). </p>
        <p>In order to use phonex, you must first become familiar with its syntax.  Phonex 2.0 has
            been updated to use many of the constructs found in regular expressions.  For more
            information, see the <i>IPA &amp; Phonex Reference</i> available from the
                <uicontrol>Help</uicontrol> menu in <i>Phon</i>.</p>
