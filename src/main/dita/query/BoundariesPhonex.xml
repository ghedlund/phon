        <p>Make a query related to syllable, word, and/or Word Group boundaries.</p>
        <p>Specific expressions allow the user to refer to boundaries in a query. These are listed
            below. Following this are examples queries using these expressions. </p>

                    <li>Make sure to distinguish between phonex queries and stress pattern queries.
                        While "#" matches a Word Group Boundary in phonex, it is a space in stress
                        pattern searching. </li>
                    <li>All boundaries are exclusive. For example, a query for all word-initial
                        phones will return all phones which are word-initial AND NOT Word Group
                        initial. </li>
                    <li>The position of the boundary marker is important. It must be at the end
                        and/or beginning of a phonex expression; it cannot be in the middle.</li>
                    <li>The alternate expressions are actually regular expressions (regex). It is
                        not necessary to use regular expressions in Phon queries, but this is
                        included for users who might already be familiar with them. If you would
                        like to learn more about regular expressions, refer to
                        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression and
