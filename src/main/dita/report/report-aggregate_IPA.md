# Report: Aggregate (IPA results)

The *Aggregate (IPA results)* query report will produce an aggreagate inventory table for results from IPA tiers.  Items in the table will be sorted phonetically.

## Example

If the given query results contain both *IPA Target* and *IPA Actual* columns the inventory is calculated for aligned pairs.  Each session sampled in the query will have a column in the inventory table.
