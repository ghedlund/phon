# Report: Inventory by Session (IPA results)

Display an inventory of IPA results for each sampled session. A separate table is displayed for each session. Items in the table are sorted by phonetically.

## Example

If the given query results contain both *IPA Target* and *IPA Actual* columns the inventory is calculated for aligned pairs.
