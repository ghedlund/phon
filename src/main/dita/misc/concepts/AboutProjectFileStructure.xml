    <title>About Project File Structure</title>
    <conbody>
        <p><i>Phon</i> projects are stored on a hard drive as directories.</p>
        <p>The directory for each project will contain the following:</p>
        <ul id="ul_dpz_jzj_rc">
            <li>A <i>project.xml</i> file which contains the information <i>Phon</i> requires for
                the project.</li>
            <li>A series of folders which correspond to each of the project's <i>corpora</i>
                (usually a collection of transcribed sessions for a specific target speaker).<ul
                    id="ul_zkz_wak_rc">
                    <li>Within each corpus folder are a series of xml files corresponding to each
                        session. The xml files which are named beginning with '~' are session
                        autosaves, created in order to prevent loss of data in the event of an
                        unexpected shutdown.</li>
                </ul></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The directory for each project may also contain the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A project resources folder called '<i>__res</i>', which is a system directory
                created by <i>Phon</i> to contain useful components for the project. This folder may
                contain: <ul id="ul_vxt_xak_rc">
                    <li>A media folder, which is the default location for the media for the project
                        and may contain media segments exported from <i>Phon</i>.</li>
                </ul></li>
            <li>A folder to contain saved query results, called '<i>__search</i>'.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><note>Projects created using earlier versions of <i>Phon</i> may exist as <i>.phon</i> files. These
                projects will need to be extracted (i.e. expanded to directories using the
                    <wintitle>Workspace</wintitle> window) to be used with the current version of
                    <i>Phon</i>.</note></p>
