        <p>Phon records are divided vertically in tiers and laterally into phonetic groups. Every
            Phon record includes the following tiers by default:<sl>
            <sli><i><xref href="orthography.dita#word_prefix">Orthography</xref></i></sli>
            <sli><i><xref href="ipa_transcription.dita">IPA Target</xref></i></sli>
            <sli><i><xref href="ipa_transcription.dita">IPA Actual</xref></i></sli>
            <sli><i>Segment</i></sli>
            <sli><i>Notes</i></sli>
        </sl></p>
        <p>Additional tiers, called <keyword>user defined tiers</keyword>, may also be added to
            record data.</p>
        <p>Tiers in Phon may be grouped, in which case each group is enclosed in a set of brackets,
            or ungrouped (i.e., the tier only has one group.) In the example below, the
            <i>Notes</i>, <i>Segment</i>, and <i>Translation</i> tiers are ungrouped while the
                <i>Orthography</i>, <i>IPA Target</i>, and <i>IPA Actual</i> tiers are grouped. As
            well, <i>Translation</i> is a user defined tier.</p>

            <title>Word Alignment</title>
            <p>Within groups, words are aligned based on space boundaries. To remove a word from
                consideration in word alignment, add a zero in front of the word in the Orthgraphy tier
                (see <xref href="orthography.dita#word_prefix"/>.) Word alignment is used during Queries
                and Analyses when searching by word is selected. (Note this also means that words
                prefixed with a zero will not appear in queries when search by word is selected.)</p>
