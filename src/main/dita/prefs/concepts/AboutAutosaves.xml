    <title>About Autosaves</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>To prevent loss of data in the event of an unexpected shutdown, <i>Phon</i> has the
            option of auto-saving sessions at regular intervals. Session autosaves are named with
            the '__autosave_' prefix.</p>
        <p>If an unexpected shutdown occurs and the user was unable to save changes to a session,
            the next time an auto-saved session is opened <i>Phon</i> will prompt the user to open
            the session in either its last user-saved state, or its last auto-saved state.</p>
        <p>To use the auto-saved session as the main session file, open it and then save it.</p>
        <p>To change the interval between autosaves, open the <wintitle>Preferences</wintitle>
            dialog. In the <wintitle>Session Editor</wintitle> tab, click on the menu in the
                <uicontrol>Autosave Sessions</uicontrol> field and choose the desired time
            interval.</p>
        <p>To de-activate the autosave option, select <uicontrol>Never</uicontrol> as the autosave
            interval.</p>
