    <title>Syllable Matcher</title>
    <body>
        <p>The syllable matcher, denoted by the small character sigma <codeph>σ</codeph> (Unicode
            character U+03C3), will match a syllable, or the remainder of a syllable. IPA
            transcripts must be correctly syllabified (see <xref
                href="session_editor/syllabification_and_alignment_view.dita"/>) for this matcher to
            work correctly. To type the syllable matcher in expressions use the autocomplete feature
            available by pressing <userinput>Tab</userinput> inside phonex input fields.</p>
        <p>A range of syllable constituent types may be specified to restrict the portion of the
            syllable potentially matched. The range of constituent types is specified using the
            following syntax:<codeblock>σ/X..Y/</codeblock>Where <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> are single
            character constituent type ids from the list:<ul id="ul_inl_b1y_xrb">
                <li><codeph>S</codeph> - syllable stress</li>
                <li><codeph>L</codeph> - left appendix</li>
                <li><codeph>O</codeph> - onset (include OEHS)</li>
                <li><codeph>N</codeph> - nucleus</li>
                <li><codeph>C</codeph> - coda</li>
                <li><codeph>R</codeph> - right appendix</li>
            </ul>Including a constituent type in the range does not necessarily mean that the
            matched portion or the transcript must include that constituent type.</p>
        <p>Examples:<ul id="ul_n2j_5xx_xrb">
                <li>Match a single syllable (including stress):<codeblock>σ</codeblock></li>
                <li>Match one or more syllables (i.e., any word):<codeblock>σ+</codeblock></li>
                <li>Match a poriton of a syllable from the onset to the nucleus (i.e., do not
                    include stress). Both the onset and nucleus characters are optional (may not
                    exist in the syllable.)<codeblock>σ/O..N/</codeblock></li>
                <li>Match a syllable which begins with one or more onsets, here the syllable matcher
                    takes on the 'remainder of' action and will match all phones from the syllable
                        rhyme.<codeblock>\c:O+σ</codeblock><p>Below is the same expression with
                        named groups 'O' and 'R' assigned to the portions of the syllable which are
                        matched by each element in the
                        expression:<codeblock>(O=\c:O+) (R=σ)</codeblock></p></li>
                <li>Match a syllable which ends with one or more codas. This demonstrates the use of
                    constituent range to match a portion of the syllable starting with the stress
                    marker and ending with the nucleus:<codeblock>σ/S..N/\c:C+</codeblock></li>
            </ul></p>
