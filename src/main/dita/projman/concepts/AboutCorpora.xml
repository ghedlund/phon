    <title>About Corpora</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>Within a project, individual transcripts (or <i>sessions</i>) are organized into a series
            of one or more <i>corpora</i>.</p>
        <p>Each corpus typically contains a series of sessions relating to one specific participant
            in a study. The corpus may contain as many sessions as desired for that participant,
            spanning any length of time. This allows the user to easily search all transcripts
            relating to one participant, by searching within the relevant corpus.</p>
        <p>When a corpus is selected, the number of sessions and a description of that corpus is
            displayed at the bottom of the list of corpora.</p>
