    <title>About Sessions</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>A session in <i>Phon</i> is a transcript of a portion of field data targeting one or more
            participants in a project.</p>
        <p><i>Phon</i> is designed to facilitate the transcription of media recordings (audio or
            video) taken of participants in a study. As such, a <i>Phon</i> session usually
            corresponds to one media recording and the transcript of this recording.</p>
        <p>A session is organized into a series of records which correspond to individual
            utterances.</p>
        <p>Sessions can be viewed in the <wintitle>Project Manager</wintitle> window. When a session
            is selected, the number of records in that session and the date it was last modified are
            displayed at the bottom of the list of sessions.</p>
