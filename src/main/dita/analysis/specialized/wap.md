# Word-level Analysis of Polysyllables (WAP)

This document outlines the Word-level Analysis of Polysyllables (WAP) report
in Phon.

## Information

The WAP (Masso, 2016) was developed in 2016 and originally published as a supplementary appendix to Masso, McLeod, Baker, McCormack (2016). The published, manual version of the WAP included seven error categories: (1) Substitution of consonants or vowels, (2) Deletion of syllables, consonants or vowels, (3) Distortion of consonants or vowels, (4) Addition of consonants or vowels, (5) Alteration of phonotactics, (6) Alteration of timing and (7) Assimilation and/or alteration of sequence. Categories 1, 2, 3 and 4 were based on the SODA analysis (substitution, omission, distortion, addition) by van Riper (1939) and categories 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 were informed by James’ (2006) work on polysyllable acquisition. Through the development of the WAP within Phon, the categories have been re-defined and embedded into the WAP analysis available in Phon.

## Data Preparation

Session data is queried by word and a WAP Table is produced for each Orthography, IPA Target, and IPA Actual triad. Proper syllabification and phone alignment is required for accurate results.  All participants should have unique names/identification numbers and a speaker should be assigned to all records.

## Word Level Inventory and Accuracy Tables

The *Word Level Stress Inventory* tables displays counts of the whole word stress productions (Target→Actual) in the sample.

Example:

| IPA Target | IPA Actual | Count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1U2 | 1U2 | 4 |
| 1U2U | 12U | 1 |
| 1U2U | 1U2U | 4 |
| 1U2U | U1U | 1 |
| 1UU | 1UU | 5 |
| 2U1 | 2U1 | 1 |
| 2U1U | 2U1U | 1 |
| 2U1UU | 2U1UU | 1 |
| U12 | 12 | 2 |
| U1U | 1U | 3 |
| U1U | U1U | 5 |
| U1UU | U1UU | 1 |
| UUU1U | UU1U | 1 |

The *Word Level Accuracy* table displays counts of whole word analyses in the five dimensions listed below. Caption for the table will be “Word Level Accuracy” followed by either “(Session)” or “(Participant)” or “(All Participants)”.

*Word Level Accuracy* dimensions and definitions:

 * **Word**  (whole word accuracy). The total number of words that were produced correctly, incorrectly, and the percentage of words produced correctly. 
 * **# Syllables** (word length correct [correct number of syllables]). The total number of words that were produced with the correct number of syllables; an incorrect number of syllables; and the percentage of words with correct length. 
 * **Stress** (lexical stress correct). The total number of words that were produced with the correct lexical stress (all syllables produced with the correct stress); number produced with incorrect lexical stress; and the percentage of words with the correct lexical stress. 
 * **CGV Shape** (target and actual CV shape with syllable stress, boundaries, and length included). The total number of words that were produced with the correct CGV shape (regardless of the accuracy of the segments); number produced with incorrect CGV shape; and the percentage of words with correct CGV shape.
 * **# Transitions** (syllable transitions correct): The total number of syllable transitions produced in the sample (total number of syllables – 1 for each word produced); the total number of segregated syllable transitions (number of intra-word pauses in target and actual); and the percentage of correct syllable transitions (correct transitions / segregated transitions + correct transitions*100).

Example:

| Category | Correct | Incorrect | % Correct |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Word | 2 | 28 | 6.67 |
| # Syllables | 22 | 8 | 73.33 |
| Stress | 22 | 8 | 73.33 |
| CGV Shape | 5 | 25 | 16.67 |
| # Transitions | 63 | 9 | 87.5 |

## Prosodic Level Inventories and Breakdown Tables

The prosodic level inventories and breakdown tables display prosodic level information from the sampled words. The *Prosodic Level Stress Inventory* and *Prosodic Level CGV Inventory* count the stress and CGV productions (Target→Actual) for each syllable in the sample. The *Prosodic Level Breakdown* table counts the accuracy and errors within stressed and unstressed syllables in 11 dimensions listed below. Captions for the tables will be "Prosodic Level Breakdown” followed by either “(Session)” or “(Participant)” or “(All Participants)”.

*Prosodic Level Breakdown* dimensions and defintions:

 * **Stress correct** The number of syllables produced with correct stress in each word position.
 * **Stress incorrect** The number of syllables produced with incorrect stress in each word position.
 * **Full syllable addition** The number of syllables that were added.
 * **Full syllable deletion**  The number of syllables that were deleted in entirety (nucleus and all onset and/or coda consonants associated with the nucleus).
 * **Partial syllable deletion (onset)** The number of syllables in which the onset was deleted but the nucleus of the syllable is realised.
 * **Partial syllable deletion (nucleus)** The number of syllables in which the nucleus vowel was deleted (but onset/coda consonants of the syllable were realised)
 * **Partial syllable deletion (coda)** The number of syllables in which the coda was deleted but the nucleus of the syllable is realised.
 * **Syllable expansion (onset)** The number of syllables in which an onset consonant was added to a syllable.
 * **Syllable expansion (coda)** The number of syllables in which a coda consonant was added to a syllable.
 * **CGV Shape correct** The number of syllables produced with correct CGV shape (regardless of accuracy).
 * **CGV Shape incorrect** The number of syllables produced with incorrect CGV shape (regardless of accuracy).

The Segmental Level Inventory counts the segmental productions (Target→Actual) in the sample. The Segmental Level Breakdown counts the accuracy and errors within onset, nucleus and coda word positions in six dimensions listed below. Percentage accuracy measures will also be displayed for consonants (onset (PCC-O), coda (PCC-C), and total consonants (PCC)), vowels (PVC) and total phones (PPC). Caption for the table will be “Segmental Level Breakdown” followed by either “(Session)” or “(Participant)” or “(All Participants)”.

*Segmental Level Breakdown* dimensions and definitions:

 * **# Target** The number of target phones in each word position (O/N/C) as well as total target consonants and total target phones (total consonants + total vowels) 
 * **# Correct** The number of phones correct in each word position (O/N/C) as well as total correct consonants and total correct phones (total consonants + total vowels)
 * **# Substitutions** The number of phones substituted in each word position (O/N/C) as well as total substituted consonants and total substituted phones (total consonants + total vowels)
 * **# Distortions** The number of distorted phones in each word position (O/N/C) as well as total distorted consonants and total distorted phones (total consonants + total vowels)
 * **# Epenthesis** The number of added phones in each word position (O/N/C) as well as total added consonants and total added phones (total consonants + total vowels)

## WAP Tables

WAP Tables are produced for each production and contains information supporting the Word, Prosodic and Segmental Level Breakdown tables.  Information is printed horizontally in a table with four columns for each table level: (1) Word Level, (2) Prosodic Level, and (3) Segmental Level. Table headings for each will be: (1) Whole Word Measure, Target, Actual, Match (i.e., are Target and Actual identical according to each word level measure. If so, True; if not, False), (2) Prosodic Alignment, Target, Position, and Description, and (3) Segmental Alignment, Target, Position, and Description. Caption for the table will be “Orthography /IPA Target/ ↔ /IPA Actual/”.

### Word Level

*Word Level Breakdown* categories:

 * **Word** (whole word accuracy). Did the Actual IPA match the Target IPA?
 * **# Syllables** (word length correct - correct number of syllables). Did the Actual number of syllables match the Target number of syllables?
 * **Stress** (lexical stress correct). Did the Actual stress pattern match the Target stress pattern?
 * **CGV Shape** (target and actual CV shape with syllable stress, boundaries, and length included). Did the Actual CGV shape match the Target CGV shape?
 * **# Transitions** (syllable transitions correct). Did the Actual number of transitions (total number of syllables – 1) match the target number of transitions?
 * **Segregated Transitions** No syllable segregations (intra-word pauses in target and actual) should be present in the Target IPA. Does the Actual number of syllable segregations match the target number of transitions (Target = 0)? If false, syllable segregation is present.
 
Example:

| Category | Target | Actual | Match |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Word | ˈbʌtəˌflaɪ | ˈbʌɾəˌfaɪ | false |
| # Syllables | 3 | 3 | true |
| Stress | 1U2 | 1U2 | true |
| CGV Shape | ˈCV.CVˌCCVV | ˈCV.CVˌCVV | false |
| # Transitions | 2 | 2 | true |
| Segregated Transitions | 0 | 0 | true |

### Prosodic Level

 * **Category** Stress/CGV Pattern
 * **IPA Target** IPA Target value
 * **IPA Actual** IPA Actual value
 * **Position** Initial/Medial/Final (syllable position within word)
 * **Description**
    - **Correct** The dimension (Target stress or CGV shape) was correct.
    - **Full syllable addition** A full syllable was added.
    - **Full syllable deletion** A full syllable was deleted (including the nucleus and all onset and/or coda consonants associated with the nucleus). 
    - **Syllable reduction (onset)** The onset (or at least one consonant of the onset) was deleted but the nucleus of the syllable was realised.
    - **Syllable reduction (nucleus)** The nucleus vowel was deleted (but onset/coda consonants of the syllable were realised).
    - **Syllable reduction (coda)** The coda (or at least one consonant of the coda) was deleted but the nucleus of the syllable was realised.
    - **Syllable expansion (onset)** A consonant was added to the onset of a syllable.
    - **Syllable expansion (coda)** A consonant was added to the coda of a syllable.
 
Example:

| Category | IPA Target | IPA Actual | Position | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stress | 1 | 1 | Initial | Correct |
|  | U | U | Medial | Correct |
|  | 2 | 2 | Final | Correct |
| CGV Pattern | CV | CV | Initial | Correct |
|  | CV | CV | Medial | Correct |
|  | CCVV | CVV | Final | Incorrect |

### Segmental Level

 * **IPA Target** IPA Target value
 * **IPA Actual** IPA Actual value
 * **Position** Onset/Nucleus/Coda
 * **Description**
    - **Correct** The phone was correct (IPA Target matched IPA Actual for target phone).
    - **Substitution** The phone was substituted (IPA Target did not match IPA actual; target phone was substituted for a different phone in IPA Actual).
    - **Distortion** The phone was distorted (IPA Target did not match IPA actual; diacritic/ did not match between IPA Target and IPA Actual).
    - **Epenthesis** The phone was added (IPA Target did not match IPA actual; phone in IPA Actual was added to an empty word position '∅' of IPA Target).
    - **Deletion** The phone was deleted (IPA Target did not match IPA actual; phone in IPA Target deleted in IPA Actual creating an empty segment in IPA Actual [∅]).
