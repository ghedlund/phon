# Analysis: Consonants

## Outline

The report will be composed of four types of tables:

 1. Clusters Summary
 1. Singletons Listing
 1. Clusters Listing
 
An example table of contents is displayed below. Bold level elements are section headers while italic items are one of the tables listed
above. Other headings are standard Phon report elements or text blocks.

## Data Preparation

Proper syllabification and phone alignment is required for accurate results. All participants should have unique names and a speaker should be
assigned to all records.

## Singletons Summary

The *Singletons Summary* table classifies singleton consonants in different syllable and word positions as being Correct, Substituted, Distorted, or Deleted.
Syllable positions are onset, coda, ambisyllabic, and oehs. (LAs and RAs should in theory never appear in syllable outside of clusters.)

Example:
