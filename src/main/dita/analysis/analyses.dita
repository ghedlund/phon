        <p>Analyses built into Phon offer ready access to general results about different aspects of
            phonological behaviours at a click. Currently-supported analyses include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Consonants: a series of analyses on phonological patterns affecting consonants
                    and consonant clusters within words, based on systematic comparisons between IPA
                    Target and IPA Actual pairs of transcribed forms.</p></li>
            <li><p>Percent Phones Correct (PPC): Series of algorithms to extract percentages of consonants and
                    vowels correct (e.g. Shriberg et al., 1997; Shriberg &amp; Kwiatkowski, 1982),
                    including at the level of consonant clusters.</p></li>
            <li><p>Phone Inventory: List of phones in IPA Target and IPA Actual tiers with their
                    frequency counts</p></li>
            <li><p>PMLU (Phonological Mean Length of Utterance): Algorithm to calculate phonological
                    complexity originally developed by Ingram (2002), with an alternate version
                    proposed by Arias &amp; Lle√≥ (2013).</p></li>
            <li><p>Word Inventory: List of words in the Orthography tier with their frequency
                    counts</p></li>
            <li><p>Phonological processes: Algorithms to detect general phonological processes such
                    as velar fronting, fricative stopping, liquid gliding, or consonant
                    deletion.</p></li>
            <li><p>Specialized analyses: More narrowly specialized analyses of multisyllabic word
                    productions (Multisyllabic Non-linear Analysis, Mason 2015; Word-level Analysis
                    of Polysyllables, Masso 2016), the Word Match analysis (Bernhardt XXXX) and the
                    Vocalization analysis (Velleman XXXX).</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The key difference between the query and reporting methods described in Query &amp;
            Report wizard and built-in analyses is that the latter combine analysis methods and
            reports at once. Running an analysis follows a three-step logic, as Phon guides the user
            through the steps laid out in the breadcrumb on top of the interface.  </p>
        <p>As with query and reporting, the user can save the report as a standalone HTML file or
            exported them in text-only (CSV) and Excel formats.</p>
