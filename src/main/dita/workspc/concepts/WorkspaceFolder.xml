    <title>Workspace Folder</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>The <i>Phon</i> workspace is the default location for <i>Phon</i> projects. Operations
            which are available from the <wintitle>Workspace</wintitle> window (such as creating,
            extracting, or archiving projects) affect files in the workspace folder.</p>
        <p>The workspace folder may contain a folder called '<i>backups</i>'. Compressed <i>Phon</i>
            projects are moved to this folder when they are archived or extracted from the workspace
            folder.</p>
