                    view is also included to streamline or automatize the transcription
                process.</p></li>
            <li><uicontrol>Validation</uicontrol><p>The <uicontrol>Validation</uicontrol> layout is

                    transcriptions when in <i>Blind mode</i>, so that one user's blind

                    automatically saved to <uicontrol>Previous</uicontrol> when the
                        <wintitle>Session Editor</wintitle> window is closed.</p></li>
