    <title>About Transcribing Phones</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>A phone object in <i>Phon</i> consists of a primary character, such as a consonant or
            vowel, and any diacritics which modify the primary character. To ensure proper
            syllabification of utterances, it is important that phones with diacritics are
            transcribed correctly.  For more information, see the <i>IPA &amp; Phonex Reference</i>
            available from the <uicontrol>Help</uicontrol> menu in <i>Phon</i>.</p>
