    <title>About Alignment</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>Displayed in the <wintitle>Syllabification &amp; Alignment</wintitle> view, the
                <uicontrol>Alignment</uicontrol> tier allows a comparison to be made between target
            (model) forms of utterances and their actual (spoken) realizations.</p>
        <p>Alignment is visualized in <i>Phon</i> as an arrangment of transcribed phones from <i>IPA
                Actual</i> lined up underneath phones from <i>IPA Target</i>. <i>Phon</i> makes a
            comparison between the number, order, and features of target phones and actual phones,
            in order to determine what phonetic information may have been lost, retained, or added
            in production.<note>To include syllabification visualization in the <i>Alignment</i>
                tier, select <uicontrol>Color in alignment</uicontrol> in the
                    <wintitle>Syllabification &amp; Alignment</wintitle> view.</note></p>

        <p>This comparison is important for a number of query scripts in <i>Phon</i>, such as
                <wintitle>Phones</wintitle>, <wintitle>Metathesis</wintitle>, and
                <wintitle>Harmony</wintitle>. These queries require information from both the <i>IPA
                Target</i> and <i>IPA Actual</i> tiers, and how the two tiers relate.</p>
            <note>When faced with irregular utterances or transcriptions, <i>Phon</i> may make
            errors in alignment. It is important to perform a visual verification of the alignment
            of transcriptions in your project in order to ensure that queries including alignment
            information will return accurate results.</note>
